# About


Hi! I'm Jesse Cai and I'm originally from the Bay Area, where I graduated from Amador Valley in 2015. 
I'm now a sophomore at UCLA pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. 
I also work for JPL, where I automate tasks through machine learning. 
This is my website, where I'll be putting up anything I find interesting, as well as some [personal projects](projects).
You can check out my resume [here](resources/Resume.pdf)

### More Information
In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess.
