Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai!

This is my website, where I write about things that interest me. In some posts, I try to explain a concept, while other posts are quick notes or describe personal projects.

If you want to get a sense of this blog I'd recommend reading these posts:
* [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
* An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
* Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
* How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) in algorithms

I try to break things down as much as possible, but if somethings unclear (or flat out wrong) please leave a PR! :)

### About me
I'm currently a junior studying computer science at UCLA.

My main interests are deep learning, algorithms and distributed/scalable systems. In my free time I like to hike, eat, or play chess.

I took a leave of absence from UCLA last year to become a machine learning engineer on the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.

Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) for half a year.

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so if you have any questions please feel free to email me. 

I'm also looking for summer internships for the summer of 2019 - preferably something research related at the intersection of deep learning and computer science. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out! 

You can reach me using one of the icons at the bottom. :smile:
