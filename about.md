Hi there! Welcome to my personal blog/website.

I'm an undergraduate researcher currently finishing my CS degree at UCLA.

My primary research interests are representation learning, transfer learning, and generative models.

In the past I've worked at [Blend](https://blend.com) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How to construct the [rational numbers](/Building-Q)
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)

In my free time I like to lift, hike, and explore nature. 

If you want to get in contact with me, feel free to email me at jcjessecai @ gmail.com
