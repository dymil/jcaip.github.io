Hi there! Welcome to my personal blog/website.

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How to construct the [rational numbers](/Building-Q)
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)


### About me

I'm an undergrad ML/NLP researcher at UCLA primarily interested in representation learning and deep probabilistic models. 

Previously I'be worked at [Blend](https://blend.com) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
In my free time I like to lift, hike, and explore nature.
