Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai and welcome to my website/blog!

This site is mostly about machine learning and computer science, but aside from that there's not really a central theme here- it's a mix of notes, personal projects, explanations, and occasionally [ramblings](/tags/#non-technical) about my experiences.

If you want to get a better sense of this blog I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) when designing algorithms

I try to break things down as much as possible, but if something is unclear (or flat out wrong) please leave a PR.

## About Me

<div style="float: right;"><img src="/resources/photo.jpg" width="220px"></div>

Currently I'm an undergraduate computer science student at UCLA.

In my free time, I like exploring nature, lifting, or playing chess.

I'm primarily interested in the following questions:
- How can we exploit structure in our data to make better predictions?
- How can we scale machine learning?
- What processes can we automate with machine learning?

Last year I took a leave of abscence to work as a machine learning engineer on the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.
Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) for about half a year.
You can find my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more information.

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so if you have any questions please feel free to email me!
