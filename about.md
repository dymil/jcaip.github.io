Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai!

I'm a UCLA CS student currently taking a gap year to work at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.

I'm currently a machine learning engineer on the data team, working towards creating the first intelligent and data-driven products at Blend. You can check out some of the work I do [here](https://blend.com/predicting-submission/).

This is my website, where I write about things that interest me - primarily [deep/machine learning](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#machine-learning), [systems](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#systems), [optimization](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#optimization), and [algorithms](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#algorithms).

If you notice a typo or mistake, please leave a PR! :)

### More Information
I'm originally from the Bay Area where I graduated from Amador Valley in 2015. After that I moved down south to study computer science at UCLA. 

Before I worked at Blend, I spent half a year working at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). It was a wonderful learning experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. 

I'm also the former President of [ACM AI](https://uclaacmai.github.io/) at UCLA, where I taught people more about machine learning and AI.
ACM AI is now in the very capable hands of [Rohan Varma](http://rohanvarma.me/) and [Adit Deshpande](https://adeshpande3.github.io/). 
If you're interested in AI/ML at all and in the LA area you should definetly [check](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclaacmai/) us out!

Before I joined full-time, I was a summer intern at Blend. You can read a bit more about us [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/blend-100-million/) and [here](https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-blend-4dd6a6106442) if you're curious about what we do.

You can check out my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more professional information.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess.
