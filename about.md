Welcome to my blog/website!

I'm currently finishing up my CS degree at UCLA, after taking a year off to work at [Blend](https://blend.com).
Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

If you want to get a better sense of this blog I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) when designing algorithms

If you spot any mistakes please leave a PR!
