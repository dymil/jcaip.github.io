Hi there!

I'm Jesse Cai, and this is my blog about stuff that interests me - mostly ml/nlp/startups.

If your new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:

- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)

I'm currently a ML Engineer at [Cultivate](https://trycultivate.com/). 

I graduated from UCLA where I used to do NLP research on representation learning.

In my free time I like lifting, exploring nature, and eating tasty things.

If you want to chat about anything feel free to reach out or email me.
