Hi there! I'm Jesse Cai, and this is my blog, where I write about my research in natural language processing and other interesting ideas in mathematics, computer science, and machine learning.
Most of what I write here is technical, but sometimes I talk about my experiences in industry/academia.

Currently, my main research interest is how to leverage unlabeled but structured data to learn better sentence embeddings.
I'm also interested in transfer learning, domain-adaptation approaches, and probabilistic models. 

My goal here is to explain things simply, but comprehensively. Usually I try to give a mix of math, code, and results, but some posts tend to skew one way or the other.
However, I am often times unclear or flat out wrong, so please leave a PR if you notice anything amiss.

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)

## About Me

I'm a ML/NLP researcher at UCLA, where I'm part of [UCLA-NLP](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

Prior to this I took a year off to join the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), where I used deep learning to identify app quality issues from NPS comments. Before that I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

I'm also currently looking for full-time roles starting 2020, so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out! (email is best)

In my free time I like lifting, exploring nature, and making bad decisions with good friends.
