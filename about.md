Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai!

I'm currently a junior at UCLA, where I study computer science. This is my website, where I write about things that interest me - primarily [machine learning](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#machine-learning), [systems](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#systems), [optimization](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#optimization), and [algorithms](https://jcaip.github.io/tags/#algorithms).

If you notice a typo or mistake, please leave a PR! :)

### More Information

I took a leave of absence from UCLA last year to work as a machine learning engineer on the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.

You can check out some of the work I did [here](https://blend.com/predicting-submission/).

Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I'm also the former President of [ACM AI](https://uclaacmai.github.io/) at UCLA, where I taught people about machine learning and AI.

You can check out my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more professional information.

I'm originally from the Bay Area where I graduated from Amador Valley High School in 2015.
In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess. 

### Contact me

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so if you have any questions please feel free to email me. 

I'm also looking for summer internships for the summer of 2019 - preferably something research related at the intersection of deep learning and computer science. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out! 

You can email me at [jcjessecai@gmail.com](mailto:jcjessecai@gmail.com).
