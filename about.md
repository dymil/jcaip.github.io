Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai!

Currently I'm an undergraduate computer science student at UCLA.

Welcome to my website/blog!

I mostly write about machine leanrning/computer science, but aside from that there's not really a central theme here- it's a mix of notes, personal projects, explanations, and occasionally [ramblings](/tags/#non-technical) about my experiences.

I'd recommend reading these posts if you want to get a sense of what this blog is about:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) when designing algorithms

I try to break things down as much as possible, but if something is unclear (or flat out wrong) please leave a PR.

I'm primarily interested in the following questions:
- How can we exploit structure in our data to make better predictions?
- How can we scale machine learning?
- What processes can we automate with machine learning?

Last year I took a leave of abscence to work as a machine learning engineer on the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.
Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) for about half a year.

I'm also looking for summer internships (or part-time work in the LA area) - preferably something research related. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out! You can find my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) and reach me at `jcjessecai@gmail.com`.

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so if you have any questions please feel free to email me.
