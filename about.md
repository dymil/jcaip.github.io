Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai and welcome to my website/blog!

In some posts, I try to explain a concept, while other posts are just quick notes or personal projects.
Occassionally I [ramble](/tags/#non-technical) about my experiences, but the vast majority of posts here are technical.

My main interests are in machine learning, generative models, algorithms, and distributed systems. 

If you want to get a sense of this blog I'd recommend reading these posts:
* [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
* An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
* Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
* How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) in algorithms

I try to break things down as much as possible, but if something is unclear (or flat out wrong) please leave a PR.

### About me
Currently I'm an undergraduate computer science at UCLA.

Last year I took a leave of abscence to work as a machine learning engineer on the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.
Before I joined Blend, I interned at [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) for half a year.

I'm also looking for summer internships (or part-time work in the LA area) - preferably something research related. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out! You can find my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) and reach me at `jcjessecai@gmail.com`.

I'm always interested in meeting new people, so if you have any questions please feel free to email me.
