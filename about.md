Hi! I'm Jesse Cai and I'm originally from the Bay Area, where I graduated from Amador Valley in 2015. 

This is my website, where I'll be putting up class notes, personal projects, and pretty much anything else that I find interesting.
I'm now a sophomore at UCLA pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
I'm primarily interested in the fields of deep learning, natrual language processing, artificial intelligence, and the scalability web systems, but I find pretty much any bit of computer science fascinating. 

### More Information

I've spent the last year working for [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), where I created web backends and automated tasks through machine learning.
It was a wonderful learning experience, but I've decided to intern at [Blend](https://blend.com/) this summer! I'm excited for what the future brings!

I'm also the former President of ACM AI at UCLA, where I taught people more about Machine Learning and AI.
ACM AI is now in the very capable hands of [Rohan Varma](http://rohanvarma.me/) and [Adit Deshpande](https://adeshpande3.github.io/).
If you're interested in AI/ML at all and in the LA area you should definetly [check](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclaacmai/) us out!

You can check out my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more professional information.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess.
