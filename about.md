Hi there, I'm Jesse Cai!

I'm a UCLA CS student currently taking a gap year to work at [Blend](https://blend.com), a startup focused on improving the consumer lending experience.
I'm currently a machine learning engineer on the data team, working towards creating the first intelligent and data-driven products at Blend. You can check out some of the work I do [here](https://blend.com/predicting-submission/)

This is my website, where I put class notes, personal projects, and anything else I find interesting. I find just about any aspect of computer science fascinating, but I'm primarily interested in deep learning, algorithms, distributed systems, and optimization methods.

### More Information
I'm originally from the Bay Area where I graduated from Amador Valley in 2015. After that I moved down south to study computer science at UCLA. 

I spent most of 2016 working on web backends for [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). It was a wonderful learning experience that I enjoyed immensly. 

I'm also the former President of ACM AI at UCLA, where I taught people more about machine learning and AI.
ACM AI is now in the very capable hands of [Rohan Varma](http://rohanvarma.me/) and [Adit Deshpande](https://adeshpande3.github.io/).
If you're interested in AI/ML at all and in the LA area you should definetly [check](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclaacmai/) us out!

Before I joined full-time, I was a summer intern at Blend. You can read a bit more about us [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/blend-100-million/) and [here](https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-blend-4dd6a6106442) if you're curious about what we do.
Also we're hiring - so apply online [here](https://blend.com/careers/)!

You can check out my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more professional information.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess.
