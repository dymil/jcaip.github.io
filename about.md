Hi there!

I'm Jesse Cai, and this is my blog about random stuff that interests me. 

If you want to get a feel for what I write about I'd recommend reading the following posts:

- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)


I went to UCLA (Go Bruins!) where I used to do NLP research on representation learning.

I'm currently a ML Engineer at [Cultivate](https://trycultivate.com/). 

In my free time I like lifting, exploring nature, and eating tasty things.

If you want to chat about anything feel free to reach out or email me.
