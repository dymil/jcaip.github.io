Hi there!

Welcome to my personal blog/website, primarily about machine learning, mathematics, and computer science.

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)

I'm an ML/NLP researcher at UCLA primarily interested in representation learning and deep probabilistic models. 

I'm also currently looking for full-time roles starting 2020, so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out!

Previously I've worked at [Blend](https://blend.com) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
