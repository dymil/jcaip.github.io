Hi there!

Welcome to my personal blog/website, where I mostly write about machine learning, mathematics, and computer science.

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- How to construct the [rational numbers](/Building-Q)
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)

### About me

I'm an undergrad ML/NLP researcher at UCLA primarily interested in representation learning and deep probabilistic models. 

Previously I've worked at [Blend](https://blend.com) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
In my free time I like to lift, hike, and explore nature. 

Feel free to email me at jcjessecai @ gmail.com if you want to get in touch.
