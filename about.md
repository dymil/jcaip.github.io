This is my personal blog about anything that interests me - mostly deep learning, mathematics, and computer science.

If you want to get a better sense of this blog I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- An overview of [Variational Autoencoders](/Variational-Autoencoders)
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
- How we can use [randomness](/Randomness) when designing algorithms

I'm currently finishing my CS degree at UCLA, after working at [Blend](https://blend.com).

If you spot any mistakes please leave a PR!
