Hi! I'm Jesse Cai!

This is my website, where I'll be putting up class notes, personal projects, and pretty much anything else that I find interesting.
I'm primarily interested in the fields of deep learning, natrual language processing, artificial intelligence, algorithms, and scalable web systems, but I find pretty much any bit of computer science fascinating. 

### More Information

I'm originally from the Bay Area where I graduated from Amador Valley in 2015. After that I moved down south to study computer science at UCLA. 

I spent most of 2016 working for [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), where I created web backends and automated tasks through machine learning. It was a wonderful experience that I enjoyed greatly. 

I'm also the former President of ACM AI at UCLA, where I taught people more about machine learning and AI.
ACM AI is now in the very capable hands of [Rohan Varma](http://rohanvarma.me/) and [Adit Deshpande](https://adeshpande3.github.io/).
If you're interested in AI/ML at all and in the LA area you should definetly [check](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uclaacmai/) us out!

I spent this summer interning at [Blend](https://blend.com/), an amazing company that I'm very grateful to work for. I'm on the data team at Blend, where my job is twofold - firstly to develop and maintain the infrastructure that creates Blend's data and secondly to analyze and apply that data to improve the home mortgage experience.

Blend was such an amazing experience that I decided to take a gap year from UCLA. I'm currently a machine learning engineer on the data team, working towards creating the first intelligent and data-driven products at Blend. I'm excited for the opportunities that Blend will face and to grow with the company!

You can read a bit more about Blend [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/blend-100-million/) and [here](https://news.greylock.com/our-investment-in-blend-4dd6a6106442).

You can check out my resume [here](/resources/Jesse_Cai_Resume.pdf) for more professional information.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, watching basketball and playing chess.
