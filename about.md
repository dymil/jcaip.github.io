Hi there! I'm Jesse Cai, and this is my personal blog.

I write about interesting concepts in machine learning, computer science, and mathematics, as well about my research in natural language processing. 

I try to explain things simply, with theoretical justification  as well as empirical results, but often times I am unclear or flat out wrong. Please leave a PR if you notice something!

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)

## About Me

I'm a ML/NLP researcher at UCLA, where I'm part of [UCLA-NLP](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/).

Currently, my main research interest is how to learn better sentence embeddings. 

I'm also interested in transfer learning, domain-adaptation approaches, and probabilistic models. 

Prior to this I took a gap year to join the data team at [Blend](https://blend.com), where I used deep learning to identify app quality issues from NPS comments. 

I'm also currently looking for full-time roles starting 2020, so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team please reach out!

In my free time I like lifting, camping, and making bad decision with good friends.
