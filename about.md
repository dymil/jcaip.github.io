Hi there!

I'm Jesse Cai and this is my personal blog/website.

I'm an ML/NLP researcher at UCLA primarily interested in representation learning and deep probabilistic models. 

I'm currently looking for full-time roles starting 2020.
Previously I've worked at [Blend](https://blend.com) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

If you think I'd be a good fit for your team or have a question about something please don't hesitate to email me at jcjessecai @ gmail.com

If you're new here I'd recommend reading the following posts:
- Experimental and theoretical analysis of [sentence representations](/Quickthoughts)
- [Distributed gradient descent](/Distbelief) in PyTorch
- Constructing the [rational numbers](/Building-Q) visually
- Using RNNs to [predict user activity](/Predicting-User-Submission)
