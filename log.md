Log of my research experience, just for kicks.

Basically converted all the code to python3 for quick thoughts, but now I need to get the eval scripts set up.

Why are people using python2 in 2019?...

Got training working + training on GPU - saw a 40x speedup (thank god).

And then I fucked up by running 
```
    chown -R jcaip /
```
by accident today... looks like when my system reboots I'll be screwed (and reinstall), but at least it's running fine right now.

JFC just trying to run this code is a PITA. looks like skip-thoughts, the original paper, needs to be cloned as well, but it uses freaking python2.7, so converting it here.

Honestly, I should probably just get this running with 2.7..... that's a bit of a bitter pill to swallow.

I just did it :(
