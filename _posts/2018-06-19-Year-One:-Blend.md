I guess this is more of a reflection of my time at Blend, and what I've learned now that I've spent a year working full-time. 

Things I like about working full-time:
The daily structure and grind. I think I've also really embraced silicon valley thinking - creating a feedback look, iterating quickly, being very opportunistic. 
I think this is a skill that I've developed a lot over this year.

The encouragement to solve solutions non-specifically. 

I like that at work, so long as I can solve the problem, nobody really cares what I do. I think also, work really encourages simple solutions. 
You're encourage to reuse code, to call into libraries, to write simple programs. 

I think the biggest thing that I enjoy about working is simply building things. 

I like to see how all the pieces interact, I like complicated systems. 

Things I don't like about working full-time:

One of my biggest opinions that has changed after working:

I used to be a big believer in simplicity, and in particular simple elegant problems to complex problems. 
And as such, I really believed that when I got a chance to build a system, it would be extremely extremely simple. 

But now I think building complicated systems is a fundamental part of building a simpler system. 
I feel I was a lot more of a perfectionist when I started Blend, but very much less so now. 

Instead I try to iterate as quickly as possible. 

There's obviously a flip-side to this though, the ability to see when you can get more return for your work, and sometimes it's worth an extra days worth of work to do something better. 

Also one huge advantage of building complicated systems to solve complicated problems is that it's fun and engaging. 

You also learn a lot about how to do things. 

And I think I'm really proud of the work at Blend. 

I've set up and maintained several key internal data servies, like Airflow and the DSTB. 
I've also built Blend's core log ingestion pipeline, which are being used now for analytics and a whole bunch of other stuff. 
I've also worked on a lot of longshot ideas - most of which have not panned out (activity submission predictor, first NPS analysis, ), but one that has (SuperNPS- comment autotagging)

I've helped mentor other engineers and constantly voice opinions, complain and otherwise function as a productive memeber of the team. I'm on-call, I write docs, I write tests, I help out when others need help and when projects need a final push (like Loan Inspector).


I've definetly learned how to think more long-trem with regards to what to do. I think this is really hard because thinking long-term takes a lot of time. It's so hard to think long-term though. 

I think the biggest thing I don't like about working is that I think you get pidgeonholed. Any task you do once is something you'll probably have to do millions of time, even if it's as a favor.
At any rate, I think I've realized that as soon as I find a niche, I should leave it. 

But I'm really excited to go back to school, to do things that I'm interested in. 

It really feels like I'm going to school for the first time, not going back to school. 

Good software requires legitamite effort.
