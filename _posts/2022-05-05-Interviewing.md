So I've recently went through a pretty intensive interview experience and wanted to share my thoughts about it. 

This is a collection of resources to find your best job. 
1. How to get an interview
2. How to prepare for the interview
3. How to understand your compensation
4. How to negotiate

I interviewed at the following companies
- Facebook
- Google
- Stripe
- Snapchat
- Moveworks
- Generally Intelligent
- Two Sigma
- HRT


# How to get an interview

The best way to get an interview is to reach out to friends and get them to refer you to companies that you want to apply to. 
You can also just flip through LinkedIn and reach out to both people who currently work there and recruiters. 

One thing that did not occur to me before is that your referer actually matters. What I mean by that is that it's generally better to get more senior and more experienced people to refer you.

The goal of this post is to explain employee compensation. 

There are two main components to your compensation.

* Equity

## Equity

Equity is given in a wide variety of forms. 
* ISO - Incentive Stock Option
* NSO - Nonqualified Stock Option
* RSU - Restricted Stock Units
* PIU - Profit Interest Units
