### Linearity of Expectations
Let $x$ and $y$ be two random variables. Linearity of Expectations states that
$$ E[x+y] = E[x] + E[y] $$
That is, the expected value of the sum is the sum of the expectations.


### Randomness in Algorithms
When you have many good choices, just pick one at random.
Randomness can be used to speed up algorithms and ensure good expected runtime.
