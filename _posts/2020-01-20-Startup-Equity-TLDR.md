A short explanation of some common concepts and an example.

## Options and Vesting

There are two main types of stock options: ISOs and RSUs. 

Usually if you get RSUs it means your startup is late stage (think Uber, Airbnb), most early-stage employees receive ISOs. 

These options allow you to buy a share of stock at your **strike price**, which is usually much lower than the actual share price. It's basically a contract allowing you to purchase stock at a reduced price. 

Companies do not give you all your options at once, they **vest** over a period of time. The most common scheme is vesting over 4 years with a one year cliff. 

This means that you get 0 options until you hit one-year from your starting date, upon which you get $\frac{12}{48}$ of your promised options. After that you get $\frac{1}{48}$ of your options every month until you've received all your options. 

The equity in offers is always structured as "$n$ shares", versus % of the company. So one of the first things you when evaluating an offer is try to figure out what % they are granting you. 

The general idea of startup options is that you can buy at your strike price and sell that stock at the market price (buy low sell high) to make money. 

## Dilution and Preferred vs. Common Stock 

Companies raise money by issuing stock, which VCs then buy.  Dilution occurs when new stock is issued as part of financing, which increase the overall total number of shares and reduces your relative %. 

However, ideally each following round also raises the valuation, so the stock price should go up too and your net benefit should be positive. 

From what I can tell you can expect 10-15% dilution from each round to the next. 

Companies can issue either common stock (what you get) or preferred stock (what investors get). 

In the event of an exit preferred stockholders get the option to either have their investment equity or their investment back (or some multiple), before the common stockholders. 

## Exiting and Taxes
One thing to keep in mind: Startup shares are pretty illiquid. 

A share, like any stock is only worth what other people are willing to pay for it. There are some markets for early startup stock but by and large, these are a very illiquid asset - you usually can only cash out if the startup is acquired or IPOs.

If you ever leave the company, your options usually expire after 90 days. This means that you'll need to either buy them (convert them into shares) by then or give them up. 

If you buy your options and then sell them within one year, you'll be charged short term capital gains tax on your return, which is currently 37%.

Otherwise if it's longer than a year before when you buy and sell you'll be charged long term capital gains tax.  This is much lower - the highest bracket (it's progressive like income tax) is 20%.

The American tax code is so complicated that there's something else called the Alternative Minimum Tax. Basically you need to pay at least x% in taxes, so if you make a bunch of money when you sell your stock then you may be taxed under the AMT rather than by the normal tax brackets. 

## Real World Example
Let's consider a concrete example: 

Say STARTUP offers you 10000 shares out of a total of 1M shares. For simplicity we'll say the strike price is 1 dollar and is equal to the current share price, making the current valuation of STARTUP 1M. 

This means you have 1% of STARTUP or a nominal 10000 dollars. 

Let's say STARTUP releases a new blockchain based iced tea and this peaks the interest of HardBank, a VC firm.

STARTUP finances this investment (Series A) by issuing another 1M shares, which HardBank buys at 5 dollars a share.

This puts the company valuation at (5 a share * 2M shares) = 10M. 

#### Scenario A 

Say later on in a year your company struggles a bit because blockchain is no longer hype and is acquired for 7M - You pull out your calculator and compute $0.01 \times 7M = 70000$.
So this means you're getting 70000 dollars right?

No, the thing is you're not getting nearly that much. 

Now first things first - when STARTIP financed that HardBank investment, your 1% was diluted to 0.5%. 

One thing to note here is the valuation of the company has went from 1M to 10M so your options have increased in paper value from 10000 to 50000.

However, when STARTUP sells for 7M this represent a "down round" or a decrease in valuation.

So in this scenario HardBank has the option to either get his investment back (5M) or his share value which is 50% of 7M or 3.5M. This is because HardBank has preferred stock. 

So after HardBank's team of quants does the math and takes the 5M, there's only 2M left, which is split among the plebs who have common stock. 

So you get 0.005 * 2M or 20000. But you need to exercise your options to for a dollar a piece, so you really only "get" 10000 dollars.

And you have to pay short term capital gains tax on that so you walk away with ~6k. 

This is a bit of a contrived example, but hopefully it shows why down rounds are so bad. The only time when you get the full acquisition value * equity percentage is if all the perferred investors (VCs) choose to get their shares instead of their investment (or investment * multiple) back. 

This can only happen if your company continues to grow bigger and bigger. If STARTUP is acquired for 100M instead of 7M then you do walk away with 500k pre-tax. 

#### Scenario B
But suppose STARTUP does really well and get's acquired for 100M. 

Then in this case, the perferred
