## An explanation of Greedy Algorithms, when to use them, and some examples


### What are Greedy Algorithms

**Greedy Algorithms** work by building the general solution one step at a time. The forego thinking about the future and take the best possible *step* each time until they have a complete solution.

### Interval Scheduling
Say you have a sequence of jobs (s(1), f(1)

### Mininium Spanning Trees
### Cut Property

#### Prim's Algorithm

#### Kruskal's Algorithm


## Proof Techniques
### Exchange argument
### Safe choices
