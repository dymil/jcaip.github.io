### Balance Sheet
![Balance Sheet](https://jcaip.github.io/images/corp_fin/balance_sheet.png)

The balance sheet is a representation of a company. It can be used to answer three fundamental questions about a company

+ On the left hand side, we can see long-term assets to solve **capital budgeting** issues
+ On the upper half, we can see short-term cash flow and **net working capital**
+ On the right hand side, we can see the investors perception of the company and **capital structure** issues

`Assets = Liabilites + Stockholders' equity`
When analyzing a balance sheet, you should be aware of liquidity, debt vs. equity, and value vs. cost

+ **Liquidity** - refers to the ease and quickness assets can be converted to cash
    + *Current assets* - most liquid and inclue cash and assets that will be turned into cash within a year
    + *Accounts receivable* - amounts not yet collected from customers for goods or services
    + *Inventory* - raw materials to be used in production or finished goods
    + *Fixed assets* - The least liquid, such as property, plant, equipment (Tangible fixed assets). Can also be intangible, such as the value of a patent or trademark
+ **Debt vs. Equity** 
    + *Liabilities* - opbigations of the firm that require cash payout within a certain time period
    + *Debt service* - will put firm in default if they are not paid - payments back to creditors
    + *Stockhoders' equity* - claim against the firm's assets that is residual and not fixed
+ **Value vs. Cost**
    + *Carrying value* - the accounting value of a firm's assets using GAAP - the mininum of either cost or market value
    + *Market value* - the price at which buyers/sellers trade the object

### Income Statement
`Revenue - Expenses = Income`

+ **Generally accepted accounting principles** - revenue is recognized when an exchange of goods or services occurs. Revenues shoud be matched with expenses. Income is reported when it is earned, even though no cash flow ahs necessarily occured. E.g. - selling for credit
+ **Noncash items** - exsist against revenues but do not affect cash flow.
    + *Deprecation* - the cost of equipment used up in the production process
    + *Deferred taxes* - arises from the difference between accounting income and true taxable income
+ **Time and Costs** - visualize short run and long run, where in the short run certain costs are fixed (bond interest, overhead, property taxes), but in the long run all costs are variable

### Net Working Capitalde
`Current assets - Current liabilities = Net working capital`
If net working capital is positive, this means that over the next 12 months, the cash that will come in is greater than the cash thatwill be paid out. 
The change in net working capital is using positive in a growing firm

### Financial Cash Flow
`Cash Flow (Assets) = Cash Flow (Creditors) + Cash Flow (Investors)`

+ *Cash flow from operations* - cash flow generated by buisness activities, including sales, but does not reflect changes in finincing, capital spending, or changes in net working capital. `Operating Cash Flow = Earnings - Deprecation - Taxes`
+ *Changes in fixed assets* - `Acquisition of fixed assets - Sale of fixed assets = Change in fixed assets`
+ *Capital spending* - `Ending net fixed assets - Beginning net fixed assets + Deprecation`
+ *Total/Free cash flow* - `Total Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Spending - Additions to net working capital`

### Cash Flow
![Cash Flow](https://jcaip.github.io/images/corp_fin/cash_flow.png)

In general cash flows recieved earlier are better than those recieved later.

### The Corporate Firm
+ **Sole proprietorship** - buisness owned by one person
    + No formal charter is required
    + No corporate income tax (taxed as personal)
    + Unlimited liability for buisness debts and obligatioins (personal and buisness assets are the same)
    + Life of the propietorship is the life of the individual
+ **Parternship** - Can either be a *general parternship* or a *limited partnership*. In a general parternship, all partners are liable for all debts, whereas in a limited partnership allows the liability of some of the partners to be limited to the amount of cash they put in. Usually one partner has to be a general partner and limited partners cannot manage the buisness
    + Usually inexcpensize to form
    + Unable to transfer ownership of a general partner unless all others agree. Limited partners may sell their buisness though
    + Hard to raise large amounts of cash
    + Income is taxes as personal income
+ **Corporation** - it's own seperate legal identity, usually composed of three sets of distinct interests - the shareholders, the directors, and top management. 
    + Ownership can be easily transfered by selling stock
    + Corporation has unlimited life
    + There shareholder's liablilty is limited to what they put in
    + Must pay corporate income tax in addition to personal income tax

### Goals of Financial Management
In general, there are many goals for different interests, but they usually center around either maxamizing profit or minimizing risk
**The goal of financial management is to maximize the current value per share of the exsisting stock**
More generally, we are trying to maximize the value of the existing owners' equity

### Agency Problem
There may be a conflict of interests between the principal and the agent
This is usually remedies by tying managerial compensation to the financial eprformance in general of the corporation, Furthermore managers want to ensure that new control does not come, as that usually means they will be replaced.
**stakeholder** - someone other than a stockholder or creditor who has a claim on the cash flows of the firm (spouse, children, etc)

### Taxes
+ **average tax rate** - tax bill / taxable income
+ **marginal tax rate** - tax percentage on the next dollar
