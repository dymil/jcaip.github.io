I just wrapped up a year working at Blend. 

I feel like this year has been dramatically different from what I expected, both in a good and bad way. 

Anyways, I wanted to share what I learned from working full-time for a year. I think it's **very** important to take what I say with a huge grain of salt, because this was just my personal experience. 

### What I Did

I've set up and maintained several key internal data servies, like Airflow and the DSTB. 

I also built Blend's core log ingestion pipeline, which has now been expanded to ingest a variety of different data sources. The spark-job airflow dag format has been adopted by Blender, our in house tool that ingests our application data, while the core logic of logs has been expanded to ingest frontend events as well. 

I also spent a lot of time working on a variety of longshot ideas, 
using an RNN to predict user submission
Trying to cluster our NPS comments 
using deep learning to identify forzen nps comments. 
This is the first real use of deep learning at Blend. 

Aside from all the engineering work I did, I also did a lot of the shitty work that engineers complain about. 

I've helped mentor other engineers and constantly voice opinions, complain and otherwise function as a productive memeber of the team.

I'm on-call, I write docs, I write tests, I help out when others need help and when projects need a final push.

I was suprised at the sheer amount of non-engineering work. Non-engineering work is also extremely valuable. 
Communication and organization are paramount. 

I joined to work on a ML product, but I didn't experience much of that at Blend. I would say that's a function of the age of the company - can't do data science when you have no data. 
I think in general though, "machine learning" at startups is usually a tier-below what you imagined. 

I think the biggest thing about Blend is that ML is not tied into their core buisness model. ML is not the product, it would just be used to enhance the product. I think in such organizations, the value proposition of ML is pretty minimal. If you really think about it, even the deep-learning autotagger doesn't provide the greatest ROI.

Organizations where machine learning is a fundamental part of the product may be different.

### Things I like about working full-time:

I think I've really embraced silicon valley thinking - creating a feedback look, iterating quickly, being very opportunistic. 


I think this is a skill that I've developed a lot over this year. I feel I was a lot more of a perfectionist when I started Blend, but very much less so now. 
Instead I try to iterate as quickly as possible. 

There's obviously a flip-side to this though, the ability to see when you can get more return for your work, and sometimes it's worth an extra days worth of work to do something better. Overall though, as someone who was very much a perfectionist beforehand, I think learning to iterate more has made me a better engineer. 

Iteration is also inherently way more scalable than doing everything in one go (you can explain to people easier.)

Another thing I like is that at work, so long as I can solve the problem, nobody really cares what I do.
Copy code, or pay for a service instead of building in-house. you're encouraged not to reinvent the wheel, to reuse code, to call into libraries, to write simple programs. 

This leads to "hacky" solutions but 

I think the biggest thing that I enjoy about working is simply building things. 

### Things I don't like about working full-time:

One of my biggest opinions that has changed after working:

I used to be a big believer in simplicity, and in particular simple elegant problems to complex problems. 
And as such, I really believed that when I got a chance to build a system, it would be extremely extremely simple. 

But now I think building complicated systems is a fundamental part of building a simpler system. 

I think the biggest thing I don't like about working is that I think you get pidgeonholed. Any task you do once is something you'll probably have to do millions of time, even if it's as a favor.

The biggest reason I decided to leave Blend was that I felt that I was stagnating, not learning anything interesting at work. 
I found myself really burnt-out as well, and in general not very productive. However I was still working on my personal projects, and really enjoyed writing code there, so I knew it was a function of Work and not my overall mental health. 

One thing that was kind of frustrating was that there wasn't much machine learning at Blend and most engineers there are pretty young. I would like to see more experience at the places I work at next.

There were some very good engineers at Blend, and I enjoyed learning from them, but I felt that especially machine learning at Blend was not very well developed. 



### What I' learned
Good software requires legitamite effort.

I think for a first job, it was fine to sort of tackle a bunch of things and just do what needed to be done - it's something I enjoy doing too because it helps people at Blend and that's a great feeling. 

But going forwards I don't think I would leave to go work for a company without a well-defined role/project. 

Should have gotten to know more people at Blend, but this is just a general thing. 


Be more collaborative as well.
