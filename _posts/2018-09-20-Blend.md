I just wrapped up a more than a year of working at Blend. 

I feel like this year has been dramatically different from what I expected, both in a good and bad way. 
Anyways I wanted to talk about working full-time for a year, what I liked and didn't like, and what I would do differently.

**NOTE:** Take what I say with a huge grain of salt, as this is just my personal experience ($$n=1$$). 

### What I Did

I deployed and maintained several internal data servies:
- Airflow - Airbnb tool responsible for scheduling Blend's ETL jobs
- DSTB (data science toolbox) - Hosted jupyter notebooks with easy connection to our Redshift cluster.
- $$\log R$$ - Blend's log archive pipeline, which has now ingests a variety of different data sources, such as frontend event data.

I also spent a lot of time working on a variety of longshot ideas: 
- using an RNN to predict user submission
- Trying to cluster our NPS comments 
- using deep learning to identify "forzen" NPS comments. 

Most of these were abject failures, but the frozen NPS classifier is still being used today! 

Aside from all the fun engineering work I did, I also spent a lot of time writing documentation/specs/tests, resolving on-call issues, reviewing code, and helping out other engineers.

Something that suprised me was just the sheer volume of "other" work that needs to be done, and the relative importance of it. I think the most effective engineers don't necessarily spend a lot of their time writing code, but rather "managing/organizing". This is definitely something that I didn't anticipate doing (or at least that I would spend the majority of my time doing these things vs. writing code).

### Things I like about working full-time:


I think this is a skill that I've developed a lot over this year. I feel I was a lot more of a perfectionist when I started Blend, but very much less so now. 

I think I've really embraced silicon valley thinking - creating a feedback look, iterating quickly, being very opportunistic. 

Instead I try to iterate as quickly as possible. 

There's obviously a flip-side to this though, the ability to see when you can get more return for your work, and sometimes it's worth an extra days worth of work to do something better. Overall though, as someone who was very much a perfectionist beforehand, I think learning to iterate more has made me a better engineer. 

Iteration is also inherently way more scalable than doing everything in one go (you can explain to people easier.)

Another thing I like is that at work, so long as I can solve the problem, nobody really cares what I do.
Copy code, or pay for a service instead of building in-house. you're encouraged not to reinvent the wheel, to reuse code, to call into libraries, to write simple programs. 

I think the biggest thing that I enjoy about working is simply building things. You spend 40 hours of week trying to accomplish this one goal, or this one project, and that's really cool, because there's not a lot of context switching.

### Things I don't like about working full-time:

I think the biggest thing I don't like about working is that I think you get pidgeonholed. Any task you do once is something you'll probably have to do millions of time, even if it's as a favor.

The biggest reason I decided to leave Blend was that I felt that I was stagnating, not learning anything interesting at work. 
I found myself really burnt-out as well, and in general not very productive. However I was still working on my personal projects, and really enjoyed writing code there, so I knew it was a function of Work and not my overall mental health.

One thing that was kind of frustrating was that there wasn't much machine learning at Blend and most engineers there are pretty young. I would like to see more experience at the places I work at next.

There were some very good engineers at Blend, and I enjoyed learning from them, but I felt that especially machine learning at Blend was not very well developed. 

On-call rotations was ridiculous. Also I think may times at Blend we were forced to put together a shitty hack rather than taking the time to come up with a more robust solution. 

### What I learned
Good software requires legitamite effort (like a lot of it).

I think the best engineers minimize the number of lines of code that they write.

I think for a first job, it was fine to sort of tackle a bunch of things and just do what needed to be done - it's something I enjoy doing too because it helps people at Blend and that's a great feeling. 

But going forwards I don't think I would leave to go work for a company without a well-defined role/project. 

Should have gotten to know more people at Blend, but this is just a general thing. 

Be more collaborative as well.

One of my biggest opinions that has changed after working:

I used to be a big believer in simplicity, and in particular simple elegant problems to complex problems. 
And as such, I really believed that when I got a chance to build a system, it would be extremely extremely simple. 

But now I think building complicated systems is a fundamental part of building a simpler system. 

I joined to work on a ML product, but I didn't experience much of that at Blend. I would say that's a function of the age of the company - can't do data science when you have no data. 
I think in general though, "machine learning" at startups is usually a tier-below what you imagined. 

I think the biggest thing about Blend is that ML is not tied into their core buisness model. ML is not the product, it would just be used to enhance the product. I think in such organizations, the value proposition of ML is pretty minimal. If you really think about it, even the deep-learning autotagger doesn't provide the greatest ROI.
