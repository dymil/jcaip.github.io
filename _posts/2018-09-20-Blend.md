I just wrapped up a year working at Blend. 

I guess this is more of a reflection of my time at Blend, and what I've learned now that I've spent a year working full-time. 

I've set up and maintained several key internal data servies, like Airflow and the DSTB. 
I've also built Blend's core log ingestion pipeline, which are being used now for analytics and a whole bunch of other stuff. 
I've also worked on a lot of longshot ideas - most of which have not panned out (activity submission predictor, first NPS analysis, app page analytics), but one that has (SuperNPS- comment autotagging).
I've helped mentor other engineers and constantly voice opinions, complain and otherwise function as a productive memeber of the team.
I'm on-call, I write docs, I write tests, I help out when others need help and when projects need a final push (like Loan Inspector).

### Things I like about working full-time:

I really enjoyed seeing the data team, and Blend as a whole grow over the year I've been there. In particular I've seen some services, like Airflow and the DSTB that I stood up evolve from proof-of-concept ideas to mission-critical components of Blend's infrastructure. 

One thing specifically that was cool to witness is Blend's log ingestion pipeline. 

I think I've written and rewritten that log ingestion like 3/4 times at this point. But now it's reached a stable state and forms the foundation of Blend's data philosophy. 
We were even able to extend the EMR framework to ingest multiple new datastores, centralizing our pipeline. 

I like that at work, so long as I can solve the problem, nobody really cares what I do.
You're encourage to reuse code, to call into libraries, to write simple programs. I think this leads to some very nifty solutions, 

All in all it was great just to build something that I hope we stand the test of time at Blend.

### Things I don't like about working full-time:
I think the biggest thing I don't like about working is that I think you get pidgeonholed. Any task you do once is something you'll probably have to do millions of time, even if it's as a favor.
But really life is too short to work on things that don't interest you in the slightest.

On-call rotation sucks. 

One thing that was kind of frustrating was that there wasn't much machine learning at Blend and most engineers there are pretty young. I would like to see more experience at the places I work at next. 

### What I learned
I've definetly learned how to think more long-trem with regards to what to do. I think this is really hard because thinking long-term takes a lot of time. It's so hard to think long-term though. 

At any rate, I think I've realized that as soon as I find a niche, I should leave it. 

But I'm really excited to go back to school, to do things that I'm interested in. 

It really feels like I'm going to school for the first time, not going back to school. 

Good software requires legitamite effort.

I think I'm much less of a perfectionist than when I first started working at Blend. 

I've become a lot more iterative in my approach to solving problems - creating a feedback loop and iterating quickly

There's obviously a flip-side to this though. It's more efficient to work in larger chunks - as there is less context switching, but at the same time you run the risk of biting off a bit more than you can chew. 

It's important to have the abiklity to see when you can get more return for your work, and sometimes it's worth an extra days worth of work to do something better.
Overall though, as someone who was very much a perfectionist beforehand, I think learning to iterate more has made me a better engineer. 

Iteration is also inherently way more scalable than doing everything in one shot ( You can explain to people easier and it'll be easier for them to help you. )

One of my biggest opinions that has changed after working:

I used to be a big believer in simplicity, and in particular simple elegant problems to complex problems. 
And as such, I really believed that when I got a chance to build a system, it would be extremely extremely simple. 

But now I think building complicated systems is a fundamental part of building a simpler system.
