Deepdive is a [factor graph](http://deepdive.stanford.edu/assets/factor_graph.pdf)

Each deepdive application is broken down into 3 main things
  + app.ddlog
  + db.url
  + deepdive.conf

There are three folders in an app
  + input/ -> Stores all the input data for the application either in a *.tsj or a *.tsj.sh
  + run/ -> Stores the run with a timestamp for all log and output files
  + udf/ -> Stores all the user defined functions refrenced in app.ddlog
