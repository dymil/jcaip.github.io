## Determining Intelligence

#### Turing Test
#### Winograd Schema

## Search

#### Formulating Search Problems
+ initial state
+ goal state
+ transition model/successor function
+ action 

The goal is to find a sequence of actions to move from the initial state to the goal state and minimize the cost of your actions

#### Solving Search Problems

Fringe, Frontier
Heurestic/Informed Search

BFS
DFS
Iterative Deepening Search
Depth Limited Serach
Tree Search
Uniform Cost Search
Best First Search
A\* Search


Seperation Property
#### Determining a Heurestic
Consistency
Admissability

How to generate heurestics

## Local Search Strategies
+ Gradient Descent
+ [Simulated Annealing](https://jcaip.github.io/Simulated-Annealing/)
+ [Genetic Algorithms](https://jcaip.github.io/Genetic-Algorithm/)

## Constraint Satisfaction

Constraint Graph
#### Types of Constraints
+ Unary Constraint
+ Binary Constraint
+ Global Constraint

#### Solving Contraint Satisfaction Problems
