## Reductions

Reductions allow us to to determine the difficulty of a problem.

We say that for two problems $$Y$$ and $$X$$, $$Y \leq_p X$$ if instances of $$Y$$ can be solved by a polynomial amount of computation plus a polynomial number of calls to a "black-box" that solves $$X$$.

### 3SAT

### Clique
We will prove that $$CLIQUE leq_p 3SAT$$.


### Vertex Cover
We will prove that $$VERTEX COVER leq_p CLIQUE$$.

### Dominating Set
We will prove that $$DOMINATING SET leq_p VERTEX COVER $$.

## Complexity Classes
### P 
### NP
### NP-Complete
### Co-NP
