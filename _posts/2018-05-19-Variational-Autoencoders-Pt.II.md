*This is a second blog post about variational autoencoders, which is more focused about implementation and application.*
*If you want, you can read my [first](/posts/Variational-Autoencoders) blog post, which covers more theory and background. *

## Implementation 

I decided to write a simple variational autoencoder in pytorch. You can check out the code [here]().


## Application 

So what can we do with variational autoencoders?

One thing we can do is to generate samples along a spectrum.
