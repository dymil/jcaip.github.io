For the past year, I have been the president of AI at UCLA, or ACM AI. 
Leading ACM AI has been a wonderful experience for me, and I would do it again in a heartbeat

Being a manager is hard
The more people you have, the more managing you have to do
You should trust your team
Relax and have fun

Conclusion
All that good shit
