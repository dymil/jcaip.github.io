1. First, we tried to use openmpi to run our code - good starting point. 
profile code

I should be able to use starcluster to spin up an OpenMPI cluster. 

I just need to change the model to use model averaging instead of this param-request approach. 

also need to figure out their bipartite graph shit

can't use a gradient norm update.

# Notes about optimal transport

kl divergence measures overlap, but if they don't overlap at all we gain no more information. 


EMD/ Wassertien distance 

can we reformat this as a continuous problem? 

divergence grows linearly with how far the distribution is from each other. 

## Monge-Kantorovich Problem 

finding distance between mu and nu

X could be a mainfold/euclidean space 

Wasserstein barycenters provides good platonic form of MNIST data.
